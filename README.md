# IBM Quantum Tutorials for QCE20

Hello! We're glad you are participating in a tutorial IBM Quantum is putting on as part of the IEEE Quantum Week. In this repository, you will find the Jupyter notebooks our instructors are using.

For our tutorials, there will be a coding component. To help you get the most out of that component, we'd like you to do the following:
* [Sign up for an account](https://ibm.co/36nWb1B) with our Quantum Experience on the IBM Cloud (aka, IQX).
* Familiarize yourself with the IQX (the [Quantum Lab](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/iql/), in particular.)
* Upload the notebooks for the tutorial(s) you signed up for into the Quantum Lab. That way you can code along with us! For instructions on how to upload your notebooks, see [this document](Uploading.md).

Note: We are finalizing the content for our tutorials, so check back soon for the notebooks!
