# Quantum machine learning for data scientists
Hello! This tutorial will be given by Bryce Fuller and Christa Zoufal of IBM Quantum. Bryce and Christa will both
give parts of the presentations as well as walk you through code examples.

In this folder you will find the notebooks we will use for the coding component of each session. Please download them
and upload them to your IQX account, using the directions in [this document](../Uploading.md).
