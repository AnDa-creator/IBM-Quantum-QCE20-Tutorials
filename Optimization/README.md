# Quantum algorithms for optimization

Hello! This tutorial will be given by Drs. Stefan Woerner and Travis Scholten of IBM Quantum. Stefan will give presentations, and Travis will walk you through code examples.

In this folder you will find the notebooks we will use for the coding component of each session. Please download them and upload them to your IQX account, using the directions in [this document](../Uploading.md).

The schedule for this tutorial is as follows. (NOTE: All times are US Mountain Daylight Time, UTC-6.)
